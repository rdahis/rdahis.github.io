Welcome to my page. I am a 6th year PhD candidate in Economics at Northwestern University. Here is my [CV](/files/CV - Ricardo Dahis.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [SSRN](https://ssrn.com/author=2786164){:target="_blank"}, [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iDi8BA8AAAAJ){:target="_blank"} and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rdahis){:target="_blank"}.

I am on the job market this year and available for interviews before, during and after the (virtual) 2021 EEA and ASSA meetings. Here is my [job market webpage](https://sites.northwestern.edu/rdahis/).

My research is at the intersection of Development, Political Economy, Public and Environmental Economics, with an emphasis on low- and middle-income countries. I study topics related to decentralization, public service delivery, deforestation, and racial inequality.

I have created the website [Base dos Dados](http://www.basedosdados.org){:target="_blank"}, as a search engine and repository of Brazilian and international data sets. It facilitates data work for academics, journalists and developers studying brazil. It is also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/basedosdados){:target="_blank"}.

I have also founded the [Empirics and Methods in Economics Conference (EMCON)](https://www.emconference.net/){:target="_blank"}. This is an annual conference for PhD students interested in applied topics and empirical methods in economics. It is jointly organised by PhD students from The University of Chicago and Northwestern University.
