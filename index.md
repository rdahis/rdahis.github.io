Welcome to my website! I am a 6th year PhD candidate in Economics at Northwestern University. My research is at the intersection of Development, Political Economy, Public, and Environmental Economics, with an emphasis on low- and middle-income countries. I study topics related to decentralization, public service delivery, deforestation, and racial inequality.

I am on the job market this year and available for interviews before, during, and after the 2021 EEA and ASSA meetings.

Here is my [job market webpage](https://sites.northwestern.edu/rdahis/), [job market paper](http://www.ricardodahis.com/files/papers/Dahis_JMP.pdf), [CV](/files/CV - Ricardo Dahis.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rdahis){:target="_blank"}, [SSRN](https://ssrn.com/author=2786164){:target="_blank"}, and [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iDi8BA8AAAAJ){:target="_blank"}.

I have co-founded [Base dos Dados](http://www.basedosdados.org){:target="_blank"}, an open data repository and search engine for Brazil. It facilitates data work for academics, journalists, policy makers, and developers.
