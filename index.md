Welcome to my website! I am a 6th year PhD candidate in Economics at Northwestern University. I do research in Development, Political Economy, and Environmental Economics, with an agenda on decentralization, public service delivery, deforestation, and racial inequality.

I am on the job market this year and available for interviews before, during, and after the 2021 EEA and ASSA meetings.
