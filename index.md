I am a 3rd year PhD student in Economics at Northwestern University. Iâ€™m also founder and co-organizer of the [Empirics and Methods in Economics Conference (EMCON)](https://www.emconference2017.wordpress.com){:target="_blank"}. Here is my [CV](/files/CV - Ricardo Dahis.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [SSRN](https://ssrn.com/author=2786164){:target="_blank"}.

I also use this website to maintain a [blog](blog) where I share texts, thoughts and discussions about various themes within Economics, Development, Psychology, Philosophy, Education, and others (in English and Portuguese).
