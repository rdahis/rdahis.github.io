Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor in Economics at PUC-Rio ([CV](/files/CV - Ricardo Dahis.pdf){:target="_blank"}). I am on [SSRN](https://ssrn.com/author=2786164){:target="_blank"}, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iDi8BA8AAAAJ){:target="_blank"}, and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rdahis){:target="_blank"}.

My research is in Development, Political Economy, and Environmental Economics, with an agenda on decentralization, public service delivery, deforestation, and racial inequality.

**Office hours**: Zoom appointments booked [online](https://calendly.com/rdahis) or by email. If the above slots donâ€™t work for you, please email me to set up a meeting.

I have co-founded [Base dos Dados](http://www.basedosdados.org){:target="_blank"}, an open data repository and search engine for Brazil. It facilitates data work for academics, journalists, policy makers, and developers.
