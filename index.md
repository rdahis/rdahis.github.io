I am a 5th year PhD candidate in Economics at Northwestern University. Here is my [CV](/files/CV - Ricardo Dahis.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [SSRN](https://ssrn.com/author=2786164){:target="_blank"} and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rdahis){:target="_blank"}.

I have created the website [Base dos Dados](http://www.basedosdados.org){:target="_blank"}, as a collaborative catalog about Brazilian and international data sets. It should be most useful for academics and journalists studying Brazil. It is also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/basedosdados){:target="_blank"}.

I have also founded the [Empirics and Methods in Economics Conference (EMCON)](https://www.emconference.net/){:target="_blank"}. This is an annual conference for PhD students interested in applied topics and empirical methods in economics. It is jointly organised by PhD students from The University of Chicago and Northwestern University.
