Welcome to my website! I am a 6th year PhD candidate in Economics at Northwestern University.

My research is in Development, Political Economy, and Environmental Economics, with an agenda on decentralization, public service delivery, deforestation, and racial inequality.

**I am joining the Economics department at PUC-Rio as an assistant professor starting in August 2021.**
