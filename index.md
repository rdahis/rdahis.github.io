Welcome to my website! I am a 6th year PhD candidate in Economics at Northwestern University. My research is at the intersection of Development, Political Economy, Public and Environmental Economics, with an emphasis on low- and middle-income countries. I study topics related to decentralization, public service delivery, deforestation, and racial inequality.

I am on the job market this year and available for interviews before, during, and after the 2021 EEA and ASSA meetings.

Here is my [job market webpage](https://sites.northwestern.edu/rdahis/), [job market paper](http://www.ricardodahis.com/files/papers/Dahis_JMP.pdf), [CV](/files/CV - Ricardo Dahis.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rdahis){:target="_blank"}, [SSRN](https://ssrn.com/author=2786164){:target="_blank"}, and [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iDi8BA8AAAAJ){:target="_blank"}.

I have created the website [Base dos Dados](http://www.basedosdados.org){:target="_blank"}, as an open data repository and search engine in Brazil. It facilitates data work for academics, journalists and developers. It is also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/basedosdados){:target="_blank"}.

I have also founded the [Empirics and Methods in Economics Conference (EMCON)](https://www.emconference.net/){:target="_blank"}. This is an annual conference for PhD students interested in applied topics and empirical methods in economics. It is jointly organised by PhD students from The University of Chicago and Northwestern University.
