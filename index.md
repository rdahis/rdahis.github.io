I am a 3rd year PhD student in Economics at Northwestern University. I’m also founder and co-organizer of the [Empirics and Methods in Economics Conference (EMCON)](www.emconference2017.wordpress.com). Here is my CV and SSRN.

I also use this website to maintain a [blog](blog.md) where I share texts, thoughts and discussions about various themes within Economics, Development, Psychology, Philosophy, Education, and others (in English and Portuguese).
