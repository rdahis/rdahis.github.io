I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Economics at Northwestern University. Here is my [CV](/files/CV - Ricardo Dahis.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [SSRN](https://ssrn.com/author=2786164){:target="_blank"}.

I also use this website to maintain a [blog](blog) (with [RSS feed](./feed.xml){:target="_blank"}) where I share texts, thoughts and discussions about various themes within Economics, Development, Psychology, Philosophy, Education, and others (in English and Portuguese).
