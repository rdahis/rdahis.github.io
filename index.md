I am a 3rd year PhD student in Economics at Northwestern University. I’m also founder and co-organizer of the [Empirics and Methods in Economics Conference (EMCON)](https://www.emconference2017.wordpress.com). Here is my [CV](/files/CV - Ricardo Dahis.pdf) and [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2786164).

I also use this website to maintain a [blog](blog.md) where I share texts, thoughts and discussions about various themes within Economics, Development, Psychology, Philosophy, Education, and others (in English and Portuguese).
