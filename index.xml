I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Economics at PUC-Rio. My research interests lie at the intersection of Development, Politics, and Environmental Economics.
I have co-founded and lead the data team at Data Basis (Base dos Dados), a nonprofit start-up with the mission to make access to high-quality data universal in Brazil. We build tools such as a search engine and a public datalake to facilitate data work for academics, journalists, policy makers, companies, and developers.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rdahis.github.io/sections/advising-teaching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rdahis.github.io/sections/advising-teaching/</guid><description>For current and prospective students, RAs, and postdocs: please read this.
