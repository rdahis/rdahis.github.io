This paper examines the effects of the PPCDAm -- a centralized set of environmental policies that effectively raised the expected cost of illegal deforestation -- on the behavior of a powerful special-interest group operating in the Brazilian Amazon: farmers. Using different identification strategies, we document that municipalities governed by farmer politicians experienced larger declines in deforestation, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, and violence than municipalities governed by other politicians after this set of policies were implemented. Our findings are consistent with the PPCDAm changing political incentives in a persistent way that amplifies its impact on environmental and social outcomes.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001554 target=blank>Published version</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/DSS_Selecting_Top_Bureaucrats.pdf target=blank>Selecting Top Bureaucrats: Admission Exams and Performance in Brazil</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://www.lauraschiavon.com/ target=blank>Laura Schiavon, </a><a href=https://sites.google.com/view/thiagoscot/ target=blank>Thiago Scot </a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><b>Accepted - Review of Economics and Statistics</b></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">January 2023</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Presented at: SBE 2019, SIOE 2020, LACEA 2020, USP NEUDC 2021, EESP</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(1)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_1> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_1 style=display:none>: In the absence of strong incentives, public service delivery crucially depends on bureaucrat selection.

Exploring monthly data on judicial output and cross-court movement, we estimate that judges account for at least 23% of the observed variation in number of cases disposed. With novel data on admission examinations, we show that judges with higher grades perform better than lower-ranked peers.

In many elections worldwide, subsidies to voter transportation are already provided or are under discussion. However, these types of incentives have not been rigorously evaluated. Here we examine possibly the world’s largest-ever intervention to lower these costs, the adoption of a fare-free public transit policy in Brazil during the 2022 national election, when about half of Brazilian voters were granted the right to use public transit for free on election days. However, while some cities adopted the benefit for both rounds of the election, others adopted it only for the second round. Using an event study design, we exploit this difference in adoption timing to examine the policy’s causal impact on voter turnout rates and human mobility levels. We find that fare-free transit increased ridership between 7.2% and 17.5% on election days, however, we estimate a precise and robust null effect of the policy on voter turnout (Coef. 0.03p.p. with standard error of 0.22p.p.). Our results illustrate that monetary transport costs may not always be a critical factor behind non-participation. Although reducing transportation costs improves access to polling places, we show that even a full transit subsidy may not be sufficient to increase voter turnout.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379423001129 target=blank>Published version</a></li><hr><h2 id=working-papers>Working Papers</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Dahis,%20de%20las%20Heras,%20Saavedra%20%282023%29%20Young%20Politicians%20and%20Long-Term%20Policy.pdf target=blank>Young Politicians and Long-Term Policy</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://twitter.com/ivanh16 target=blank>Iván de las Heras, </a><a href=https://sites.google.com/view/santiago-saavedra target=blank>Santiago Saavedra </a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><b>Submitted</b></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">February 2024</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Presented at: ICDE, ACU Political Economy Workshop</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(3)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_3> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_3 style=display:none>: Policies often entail costs today but benefits only far into the future, as in climate change mitigation.

We further show that young politicians invest in long-term policy and hire more young bureaucrats.

We examine the economic consequences of redistricting through the creation of smaller government units. Exploiting reforms that led to sharp variations in the number of government units in Brazil, we show that voluntary redistricting increases the size of the public sector, public services delivery, and economic activity in new local governments over the long-term. These benefits are not offset by losses elsewhere and are stronger in peripheral and remote backward areas that are neglected by their parent governments. We provide evidence that the decentralization of decision-making power boosts local development in disadvantaged areas beyond simply gains in fiscal revenues.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-50402258 target=blank>BBC Brasil</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Vieira,%20Dahis,%20Assuncao%20%282023%29%20The%20Role%20of%20Sanctions%20and%20Spillovers%20in%20Forest%20Conservation.pdf target=blank>The Role of Sanctions and Spillovers in Forest Conservation</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://github.com/jpgmv1998 target=blank>João Pedro Vieira, </a><a href=https://www.econ.puc-rio.br/juliano/ target=blank>Juliano Assunção </a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">August 2023</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Presented at: Universidad de Los Andes, Universidad del Chile, RTI TREE</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(5)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_5> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_5 style=display:none>: We study how environmental sanctions and spillovers improve forest conservation in the Brazilian Amazon. Using a difference-in-differences framework and novel farm-level data, we show that sanctions curbed deforestation and promoted reforestation among punished farmers and their neighbors. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that even sanctions with limited incapacitation potential elicited relevant behavioral changes. In particular, farmers’ responsiveness to sanctions coincided with the government’s commitment to enforcement. We do not find substantial evidence of spatial displacement or monitoring evasion. Overall, sanctions prevented 1.6 billion tons of CO2 emissions between 2006 and 2019, equivalent to 31% of US emissions in 2021.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vqpkm/ target=blank>SocArXiv</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4499312" target=blank>Calculating the Economic Value of Non-marginal Mortality Risk Reductions</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://www.diegoscardoso.com/ target=blank>Diego Cardoso </a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><b>R&amp;R Economic Letters</b></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">December 2023</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(6)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_6> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_6 style=display:none>: Cost-benefit analyses in public health typically calculate the benefits of mortality reduction interventions by multiplying the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) and the expected decrease in fatalities.

Building on the theoretical framework of the VSL, we outline a practical approach to calculate the benefits of non-marginal mortality reductions with empirically-calibrated compensating variations.

We conclude by laying out a roadmap to guide the organization&#39;s future steps.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Dahis_Advice_Research.pdf target=blank>Advice for Academic Research</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">March 2021</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Dahis_Ideology.pdf target=blank>Ideology: A Nine-Dimensional Label</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">September 2020</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(18)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_18> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_18 style=display:none>: Assuming that ideology, or political positions, can be meaningfully partitioned into groups of issues, in this essay I outline a nine-dimensional political label that is (i) much more informative than a one-dimensional left-right divide and (ii) still relatively simple to communicate. I first describe political labels as simplifying devices that reduce dimensionality from the full position space, then introduce the label and, lastly, I discuss how the framework relates to basic questions in politics.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Dahis_BC.pdf target=blank>The Belief Cloud: Framework and Applications</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">May 2020</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(19)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_19> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_19 style=display:none>: This essay introduces the concept of a belief cloud as a representation of belief structure over claims humans can make. It divides claims into facts, and those others that are still open for debate. The cloud represents the current state of our knowledge, and it also helps visualizing how it grows. Based on this framework, I discuss various applications in communication, policy making, business, and science.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/randomness_probability.pdf target=blank>On Randomness and Probability</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">May 2019</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(20)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_20> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_20 style=display:none>: This essay provides coherent definitions of two bedrock concepts in philosophy and statistics: randomness and probability. When constructing the first, I define repeatability, the measurement set, and distinguish between frequency vs. value prediction. The definition of randomness proposed, namely of a random variable not being perfectly value-predictable for any given information set, is stronger than those commonly used in the literature. Second, after defining probability as a theory about a variable&#39;s potential frequency distribution, I argue that the dichotomy between frequentist and bayesian interpretations is illusory. I conclude with remarks about knowledge and determinism.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Dahis_IEAS.pdf target=blank>Is Economics a Science? Not Yet</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">February 2018</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(21)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_21> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_21 style=display:none>: Is economics a science? Answering this question is not only necessary for philosophical clarity, but also crucial for knowing how seriously to take economists’ claims and advice about public policy. Nevertheless, even among practitioners and academics, consensus is nonexistent. This paper resolves the conundrum in two steps. First I discuss some epistemology of science, defining clearly various concepts necessary to the debate. Several fallacies are clarified, such as &#34;a theory may never be proved true, but only not falsified&#34;, &#34;a model is useful because it simplifies reality&#34; or &#34;data mining is bad&#34;. In light of solid philosophical ground, I then discuss the practice and methodology of modern economics. The answer to the title question is a perhaps disappointing, but realistic, not yet. I conclude with prescriptions for a path towards a more scientific discipline.</span></p><hr><h2 id=code>Code</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Cleaning the &#39;Relação Anual de Informações Sociais&#39; (RAIS) dataset on Stata, 1985-2018</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://github.com/rdahis/clean_RAIS target=blank>Github Repository</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Template for Empirical Papers</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">This folder provides an all-encompassing working structure for empirical papers.
