Despite wide adoption by governments, it is unclear whether civil service examinations reliably select for job performance. We investigate this question focusing on state judges in Brazil. Exploring monthly data on judicial output and cross-court movement, we estimate that judges account for at least 23% of the observed variation in number of cases disposed. With novel data on admission examinations, we show that judges with higher grades perform better than lower-ranked peers. Our results suggest competitive examinations can be an effective way to screen candidates.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Braganca%20and%20Dahis%20%282021%29%20Cutting%20Special%20Interests%20by%20the%20Roots.pdf target=blank>Cutting Special Interests by the Roots: Evidence from the Brazilian Amazon</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Arthur Bragança)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">R&amp;R Journal of Public Economics, July 2021</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(1)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_1> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_1 style=display:none>: Government policies may impact economic outcomes directly but also indirectly through effects on political equilibria. This paper examines the effects of the PPCDAm – a centralized environmental policy that synced real-time satellite deforestation data with enforcement on the ground – on the behavior and electoral outcomes of a powerful special-interest group operating in the Brazilian Amazon: farmers. Exploiting close elections, we document that municipalities governed by farmer mayors had higher deforestation rates and CO2e emissions, earmarked more resources to agriculture, and experienced more land-related conflict before, but not after, the PPCDAm was implemented. Any electoral advantage these mayors had before the policy also disappears with the introduction of the PPCDAm. Our findings are consistent with a political agency model where candidates use their occupation to signal commitment to deforestation.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Dahis%20and%20Szerman%20%282021%29%20Development%20via%20Administrative%20Redistricting.pdf target=blank>Development via Administrative Redistricting: Evidence from Brazil</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Christiane Szerman)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">May 2021</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(2)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_2> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_2 style=display:none>: We exploit a large redistricting episode in Brazil to examine if, and how, administrative unit splits impact local development. Using a rich panel of administrative and spatial data, we first document that requests to split are more likely to be initiated by poor and rural districts. Employing a difference-in-differences strategy with areas whose requests to split were never approved serving as a control group, we find that splitting leads to an expansion of the public sector, some improvements in public service delivery and children&#39;s education attainment, but no impacts on the private sector. Meanwhile, outcomes are unaffected in parent municipalities. Results are consistent with adaptations of policy to local preferences. Our results inform the equity-efficiency trade-off embedded in decentralization reforms worldwide.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-50402258 target=blank>Coverage BBC Brasil</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/DNQ_2020_0608_FINAL.pdf target=blank>Changing Racial Identity in the United States, 1880-1940</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Emily Nix and Nancy Qian)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Under Review, June 2020</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(3)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_3> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_3 style=display:none>: This paper documents that a large number of African American men experienced a change in racial identity to white during 1880 to 1940, while analogous changes were negligible for other races. We provide descriptive evidence that is consistent with the conventional wisdom that “passing” for white was a response to severe discrimination, and came at great personal cost. The findings suggest that contrary to traditional economic thinking, racial identity is neither entirely exogenous nor fixed over the lifetime, and responds to incentives.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QluGZdvuc5lFtt2ygnEtC?si=gSSl7uggTbqXu-LU3YvRSQ" target=blank>The Weeds (40:45)</a></li><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/jim-crow-era-discrimination-violence-black-men-passed-white target=blank>Kellogg Insight</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Bessone,%20Dahis,%20and%20Ho%20%282021%29%20The%20Impact%20of%203G%20Mobile%20Internet%20on%20Educational%20Outcomes%20in%20Brazil.pdf target=blank>The Impact of 3G Mobile Internet on Educational Outcomes in Brazil</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Pedro Bessone and Lisa Ho)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Under Review, April 2021</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(4)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_4> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_4 style=display:none>: What is the impact of mobile broadband internet on children&#39;s test scores? We compare standardized test scores before and after the staggered entry of 3G into Brazil&#39;s 5,570 municipalities using a heterogeneity-robust event-study design. We find no effects of mobile internet on test scores for 5th or 9th grade students, and can reject effect sizes of 0.04 standard deviations in both math and Portuguese.

This approach approximates risk premia for small changes in mortality, but inaccurately characterizes premia for large risk changes because it implies increasing marginal utility and a risk-loving attitude. We propose a method to calculate the benefits of large mortality reductions adjusting for risk aversion. We apply this method to calculate the benefits of social distancing and other mitigation strategies to combat COVID-19 in the US and 42 other countries. Our findings show that the typical approach underestimates the benefits of social distancing in the US by a factor of 4.1 and in other countries by a factor of 2.2 on average.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/nacional/2020/04/22/quarentena-intensiva-traria-beneficio-de-r-298-bi-por-mes-ao-pais-diz-pesquisa target=blank>CNN Brasil</a></li><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://mercadopopular.org/economia/os-beneficios-economicos-do-distanciamento-social/ target=blank>Instituto Mercado Popular</a></li><hr><h2 id=work-in-progress>Work in Progress</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Promotions, Performance, and Diversity in the Brazilian Judiciary</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Laura Schiavon and Thiago Scot)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Killing the Forest: Assassinations and Deforestation in Brazil</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Mariana Carvalho and Thiago Ventura)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Family Concentration in Public and Private Organizations</h3><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Genocide and the Demand for Formal Institutions: Evidence from the Legacy of the Khmer Rouge</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Dennis Egger and Joris Mueller)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(9)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_9> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_9 style=display:none>: The Cambodian genocide under the Khmer Rouge regime is remembered as one of the worst human tragedies of the 20th century. This paper examines the social and institutional legacies of this violent episode. We document that spatially more intense violence committed by the Khmer Rouge, proxied by exogenous adverse rainfall shocks during 1975–1977, is associated with a higher fraction of land covered by government-backed land titles in Cambodia today. We provide micro-level empirical evidence that social capital may play a role in explaining this result: Communities that experienced more violence had more of their social capital destroyed, increasing the demand for formal titles. We conclude that social capital may serve as a substitute for formal institutions in a context of weak state capacity. We complement our analysis by discussing several alternative mechanisms.</span></p><hr><h2 id=other-writing>Other Writing</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Dahis_Advice_Research.pdf target=blank>Advice for Academic Research</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">March 2021</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Dahis_Ideology.pdf target=blank>Ideology: A Nine-Dimensional Label</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">September 2020</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(11)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_11> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_11 style=display:none>: Assuming that ideology, or political positions, can be meaningfully partitioned into groups of issues, in this essay I outline a nine-dimensional political label that is (i) much more informative than a one-dimensional left-right divide and (ii) still relatively simple to communicate.

When constructing the first, I define repeatability, the measurement set, and distinguish between frequency vs. value prediction. The definition of randomness proposed, namely of a random variable not being perfectly value-predictable for any given information set, is stronger than those commonly used in the literature. Second, after defining probability as a theory about a variable&#39;s potential frequency distribution, I argue that the dichotomy between frequentist and bayesian interpretations is illusory. I conclude with remarks about knowledge and determinism.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Dahis_IEAS.pdf target=blank>Is Economics a Science?

Answering this question is not only necessary for philosophical clarity, but also crucial for knowing how seriously to take economists’ claims and advice about public policy. Nevertheless, even among practitioners and academics, consensus is nonexistent. This paper resolves the conundrum in two steps. First I discuss some epistemology of science, defining clearly various concepts necessary to the debate. Several fallacies are clarified, such as &#34;a theory may never be proved true, but only not falsified&#34;, &#34;a model is useful because it simplifies reality&#34; or &#34;data mining is bad&#34;. In light of solid philosophical ground, I then discuss the practice and methodology of modern economics. The answer to the title question is a perhaps disappointing, but realistic, not yet. I conclude with prescriptions for a path towards a more scientific discipline.</span></p><hr><h2 id=code>Code</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Cleaning the Relação Anual de Informações Sociais (RAIS) dataset on Stata, 1985-2018</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://github.com/rdahis/clean_RAIS target=blank>Github Repository</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Template for Empirical Papers</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">This folder provides an all-encompassing working structure for empirical papers.
