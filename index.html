This paper examines the effects of the PPCDAm -- a centralized set of environmental policies that effectively raised the expected cost of illegal deforestation -- on the behavior of a powerful special-interest group operating in the Brazilian Amazon: farmers. Using different identification strategies, we document that municipalities governed by farmer politicians experienced larger declines in deforestation, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, and violence than municipalities governed by other politicians after this set of policies were implemented. Our findings are consistent with the PPCDAm changing political incentives in a persistent way that amplifies its impact on environmental and social outcomes.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001554 target=blank>Published version</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/DSS_Selecting_Top_Bureaucrats.pdf target=blank>Selecting Top Bureaucrats: Admission Exams and Performance in Brazil</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://www.lauraschiavon.com/ target=blank>Laura Schiavon </a><a href=https://sites.google.com/view/thiagoscot/ target=blank>Thiago Scot </a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><b>Accepted - Review of Economics and Statistics</b></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">July 2022</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(1)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_1> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_1 style=display:none>: In the absence of strong incentives, public service delivery crucially depends on bureaucrat selection. Despite wide adoption by governments, it is unclear whether civil service examinations reliably select for job performance. We investigate this question focusing on state judges in Brazil. Exploring monthly data on judicial output and cross-court movement, we estimate that judges account for at least 23% of the observed variation in number of cases disposed. With novel data on admission examinations, we show that judges with higher grades perform better than lower-ranked peers. Our results suggest competitive examinations can be an effective way to screen candidates.</span></p><hr><h2 id=working-papers>Working Papers</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/Dahis%20et%20al%20%282022%29%20Data%20Basis%20-%20Universalizing%20Access%20to%20High-Quality%20Data.pdf target=blank>Data Basis (Base dos Dados) - Universalizing Access to High-Quality Data</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://github.com/JoaoCarabetta target=blank>João Carabetta </a><a href=https://github.com/fernandascovino target=blank>Fernanda Scovino </a><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/fred-israel target=blank>Frederico Israel </a><a href=https://github.com/d116626 target=blank>Diego Oliveira </a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">July 2022</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(2)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_2> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_2 style=display:none>: In this paper we explain how the Data Basis platform helps decisively solve the data access problem for different types of users.

We exemplify the platform’s utility with discussions of three datasets on labor markets, elections, and local public finances in Brazil. The project is extraordinarily cost-effective: dividing a measure of yearly benefits generated by a conservative estimate of yearly costs to run the organization yields a lower bound social return of 74.

Using a rich panel of administrative and spatial data, we first document that requests to split are more likely to be initiated by poor and rural districts. Employing a difference-in-differences strategy with areas whose requests to split were never approved serving as a control group, we find that splitting leads to an expansion of the public sector, some improvements in public service delivery and children&#39;s education attainment, but no impacts on the private sector. Meanwhile, outcomes are unaffected in parent municipalities. Results are consistent with adaptations of policy to local preferences. Our results inform the equity-efficiency trade-off embedded in decentralization reforms worldwide.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-50402258 target=blank>BBC Brasil</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=/papers/DNQ_2020_0608_FINAL.pdf target=blank>Changing Racial Identity in the United States, 1880-1940</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/emilyenix/ target=blank>Emily Nix </a><a href=https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/qian/ target=blank>Nancy Qian </a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">June 2020</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(4)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_4> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_4 style=display:none>: This paper documents that a large number of African American men experienced a change in racial identity to white during 1880 to 1940, while analogous changes were negligible for other races.

This approach approximates risk premia for small changes in mortality, but inaccurately characterizes premia for large risk changes because it implies increasing marginal utility and a risk-loving attitude. We propose a method to calculate the benefits of large mortality reductions adjusting for risk aversion. We apply this method to calculate the benefits of social distancing and other mitigation strategies to combat COVID-19 in the US and 42 other countries. Our findings show that the typical approach underestimates the benefits of social distancing in the US by a factor of 4.1 and in other countries by a factor of 2.2 on average.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/nacional/2020/04/22/quarentena-intensiva-traria-beneficio-de-r-298-bi-por-mes-ao-pais-diz-pesquisa target=blank>CNN Brasil</a></li><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://mercadopopular.org/economia/os-beneficios-economicos-do-distanciamento-social/ target=blank>Instituto Mercado Popular</a></li><hr><h2 id=work-in-progress>Work in Progress</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Politicians&#39; Age and Long-Term Policy: Evidence from the Brazilian Amazon</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href target=blank>Iván de las Heras </a><a href=https://sites.google.com/view/santiago-saavedra target=blank>Santiago Saavedra </a>)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Administrative Remoteness and Deforestation: Evidence from the Brazilian Amazon</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://github.com/jpgmv1998 target=blank>João Pedro Vieira </a>)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Export-Induced Deforestation and Political Change: The Unintended Consequences of the Rise of China</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://lei-li-economics.weebly.com/ target=blank>Lei Li </a>)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Promotions, Performance, and Diversity in the Brazilian Judiciary</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://www.lauraschiavon.com/ target=blank>Laura Schiavon </a><a href=https://sites.google.com/view/thiagoscot/ target=blank>Thiago Scot </a>)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Local Procurement and Firm Performance</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/thiagoscot/ target=blank>Thiago Scot </a><a href=https://bernardoricca.wixsite.com/bricca target=blank>Bernardo Ricca </a>)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Housing Microfinance and Climate Resilience in the Philippines</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://www.teevratgarg.com/ target=blank>Teevrat Garg </a><a href=https://sites.google.com/a/cornell.edu/russelltoth/ target=blank>Russell Toth </a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(12)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_12> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_12 style=display:none>: Low-income households in the Philippines lack sufficient access to affordable and resilient housing to protect them from the physical and economic damages brought by increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as typhoons and floods.

We will run a 2x2 randomized evaluation that cross-randomizes the education component (versus no education) and the new housing loan terms (versus being offered the old housing loan terms), against a control group. The main outcomes are short-term impacts on perceptions of climate risk and resilience, knowledge and plans for house construction, and other measures of resilience. The study will create new knowledge about how to support low-income households in obtaining housing that is resilient to extreme weather events, which is relevant across a number of developing countries that are vulnerable to climate change.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/9124 target=blank>AEA RCT Registry 9124</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Digital Networks and the Diffusion of Political Movements</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href=https://www.jorismueller.com/ target=blank>Joris Mueller </a><a href=https://utsavmanjeer.com/ target=blank>Utsav Manjeer </a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(13)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_13> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_13 style=display:none>: We exploit the staggered introduction of 3G mobile internet in Africa to examine the effect of new communication technologies on the spread of political unrest in and across countries.

Answering this question is not only necessary for philosophical clarity, but also crucial for knowing how seriously to take economists’ claims and advice about public policy. Nevertheless, even among practitioners and academics, consensus is nonexistent. This paper resolves the conundrum in two steps. First I discuss some epistemology of science, defining clearly various concepts necessary to the debate. Several fallacies are clarified, such as &#34;a theory may never be proved true, but only not falsified&#34;, &#34;a model is useful because it simplifies reality&#34; or &#34;data mining is bad&#34;. In light of solid philosophical ground, I then discuss the practice and methodology of modern economics. The answer to the title question is a perhaps disappointing, but realistic, not yet.
