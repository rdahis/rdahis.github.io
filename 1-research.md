- **Value of a Statistical Life Under Large Mortality Risk Change: Theory and an Application to COVID-19**. May 2020 [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3599529){:target="_blank"}] (with [Diego S. Cardoso](https://sites.google.com/view/diegocardoso/){:target="_blank"})

    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Benefit analyses of mortality reduction policies typically use multiples of the value of a statistical life (VSL). This approach approximates risk premia for small changes in mortality, but inaccurately estimates premia for large risk changes because it implies increasing marginal utility and a risk-loving attitude. We propose a simple method to calculate the benefit of large mortality reductions adjusting for risk aversion. We apply this method to calculate the benefits of social distancing and other mitigation strategies to combat COVID-19 in the US and 42 other countries. Our findings show that the traditional approach may underestimate the benefits of social distancing in the U.S. by a factor of 4, and by a factor of 2, on average, for other countries. </p>

- **Voluntary Secessions and Development: Evidence from Brazilian Municipalities**. February 2018 [[SSRN](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3125757){:target="_blank"}] (with [Christiane Szerman](https://scholar.princeton.edu/cszerman/bio){:target="_blank"})

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> We exploit a period of proliferation of new administrative units in Brazil between 1988 and 2010, in which 1,146 municipalities were created (an increase of 35%), to investigate the short- and medium-term effects of secessions on socio-economic outcomes. We first argue that elite capture and fiscal incentives play an important role in secessions. Because the decision to secede is not random, we collect data on municipalities that had secession requests denied due to a Constitutional Amendment that curbed the formation of new municipalities after 1996 to create a control group for municipalities that seceded. Using past tract-level Census data to reconstruct outcomes for new boundaries, we find that secession is associated with better education, health, wealth, and public service outcomes. We document that the positive effects are mostly driven by new municipalities, while old municipalities present negligible changes. We show that increases in revenues do not fully explain our findings and we discuss further mechanisms, such as changes in state capacity, infrastructure, and migration. </p>

- **Politics, Monitoring and Deforestation in the Amazon**.  (with [Arthur Bragança](https://arthurbraganca.com/){:target="_blank"})

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> Decentralized governments typically rely on local politicians to implement policies designed at the national level. In order to avoid obstruction, the government may align incentives directly, with monitoring and punishment, or indirectly, by altering the electoral incentives politicians are subject to. This paper studies how a new policy, which synced real-time satellite deforestation data with enforcement on the ground, affected the behavior of mayors connected to farming by making pro-agriculture actions less profitable electorally. To do so, we assemble a comprehensive data set covering six electoral terms and implement a close-elections Regression-Discontinuity design. Our results show that, before the reform, municipalities governed by farmer mayors earmarked more resources to subsidize agriculture and had higher deforestation rates. However, after the reform, these differences disappear. We provide suggestive evidence that the policy affected political entry, by making running for office less attractive for farmer candidates. Our findings indicate that the decline of the politi- cal influence of interest groups representing agriculture was an important mechanism through which the increases in the enforcement of the environmental legislation re- duced deforestation. </p>

- **Selecting Top Bureaucrats: Admission Exams and Performance in Brazil**. April 2020 [[SSRN](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3584725){:target="_blank"}] (with Laura Schiavon and Thiago Scot)

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> In the absence of strong incentive schemes, public service delivery depends crucially on bureaucrat selection. Despite being widely adopted by governments to screen candidates, it is unclear whether civil service examinations can predict performance on the job. This paper investigates this question focusing on a highly prestigious and influential set of bureaucrats in Brazil: state judges. We first explore rich data on judges’ monthly output and cross-court movement to separately identify what share of observed performance is explained by judges and courts. We estimate that judges account for at least 23% of the observed variation in the number of cases disposed. Using a novel data set on examinations, we then show that, within cohorts of candidates taking the same exam, those with higher grades perform better than their lower-ranked peers. Our results suggest that competitive examinations can be an effective way to screen candidates, even among highly qualified contenders. </p>

- **Changing Racial Identity in the United States, 1880-1940**. November 2019 [[NBER Working Paper w26465](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26465){:target="_blank"}] (with [Emily Nix](https://sites.google.com/site/emilyenix/){:target="_blank"} and [Nancy Qian](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/qian/){:target="_blank"}) _Submitted_

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> This paper documents that many black males experienced a change in racial classification to white in the United States, 1880–1940, while changes in racial classification were negligible for other races. We provide a rich set of descriptive evidence on the lives of black men "passing" for white, such as their patterns of marriage, children, the passing of spouses and children, migration and income. </p>

# Work in Progress

- **Choosing Institutions Locally: Determinants of Legislative Size in Brazil**. April 2015 (available upon request)

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> How are institutions determined? This paper studies how legislators locally choose an important dimension of local electoral systems, namely legislative size. To achieve this end, I construct a novel data set comprised of seat proposals and individual legislators’ votes to increase or not legislative size during the pre-2012 election period for a sample of municipalities in Brazil. I then outline and estimate a structural discrete choice model of legislative vote, in which legislators play a strategic game and also decide whether to run for reelection or not. I find that legislators weigh on average approximately 34% reelection payoffs and 66% social welfare when choosing seats. With these results, I run some counterfactual analyses varying the population caps’ function that federal government chooses. </p>

- **Genocide and the Demand for Formal Institutions: Evidence from the Legacy of the Khmer Rouge** (with Joris Mueller)

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Cambodian genocide under the Khmer Rouge regime is remembered as one of the worst human tragedies of the 20th century. This paper examines the social and institutional legacies of this violent episode. We document that spatially more intense violence committed by the Khmer Rouge, proxied by exogenous adverse rainfall shocks during 1975–1977, is associated with a higher fraction of land covered by government-backed land titles in Cambodia today. We provide micro-level empirical evidence that social capital may play a role in explaining this result: Communities that experienced more violence had more of their social capital destroyed, increasing the demand for formal titles. We conclude that social capital may serve as a substitute for formal institutions in a context of weak state capacity. We complement our analysis by discussing several alternative mechanisms. </p>
