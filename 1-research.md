- **Voluntary Secessions and Development: Evidence from Brazilian Municipalities** [[SSRN](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3125757){:target="_blank"}] (with [Christiane Szerman](https://scholar.princeton.edu/cszerman/bio){:target="_blank"})

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> We exploit a period of proliferation of new administrative units in Brazil between 1988 and 2010, in which 1,146 municipalities were created (an increase of 35%), to investigate the short- and medium-term effects of secessions on socio-economic outcomes. We first argue that elite capture and fiscal incentives play an important role in secessions. Because the decision to secede is not random, we collect data on municipalities that had secession requests denied due to a Constitutional Amendment that curbed the formation of new municipalities after 1996 to create a control group for municipalities that seceded. Using past tract-level Census data to reconstruct outcomes for new boundaries, we find that secession is associated with better education, health, wealth, and public service outcomes. We document that the positive effects are mostly driven by new municipalities, while old municipalities present negligible changes. We show that increases in revenues do not fully explain our findings and we discuss further mechanisms, such as changes in state capacity, infrastructure, and migration. </p>

- **Politics, Monitoring and Deforestation in the Amazon** (with [Arthur Bragança](https://arthurbraganca.com/){:target="_blank"})

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> Decentralized governments typically rely on local politicians to implement policies designed at the national level. In order to avoid obstruction, the government may align incentives directly, with monitoring and punishment, or indirectly, by altering the electoral incentives politicians are subject to. This paper studies how a new policy, which synced real-time satellite deforestation data with enforcement on the ground, affected the behavior of mayors connected to farming by making pro-agriculture actions less profitable electorally. To do so, we assemble a comprehensive data set covering six electoral terms and implement a close-elections Regression-Discontinuity design. Our results show that, before the reform, municipalities governed by farmer mayors earmarked more resources to subsidize agriculture and had higher deforestation rates. However, after the reform, these differences disappear. We provide suggestive evidence that the policy affected political entry, by making running for office less attractive for farmer candidates. Our findings indicate that the decline of the politi- cal influence of interest groups representing agriculture was an important mechanism through which the increases in the enforcement of the environmental legislation re- duced deforestation. </p>

- **Changing Racial Identity in the United States, 1880-1940** [[NBER Working Paper w26465](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26465){:target="_blank"}] (with [Emily Nix](https://sites.google.com/site/emilyenix/){:target="_blank"} and [Nancy Qian](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/qian/){:target="_blank"}) _Submitted_

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> This paper documents that many black males experienced a change in racial classification to white in the United States, 1880–1940, while changes in racial classification were negligible for other races. We provide a rich set of descriptive evidence on the lives of black men "passing" for white, such as their patterns of marriage, children, the passing of spouses and children, migration and income. </p>

- **Choosing Institutions Locally: Determinants of Legislative Size in Brazil** (available upon request)

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> How are institutions determined? This paper studies how legislators locally choose an important dimension of local electoral systems, namely legislative size. To achieve this end, I construct a novel data set comprised of seat proposals and individual legislators’ votes to increase or not legislative size during the pre-2012 election period for a sample of municipalities in Brazil. I then outline and estimate a structural discrete choice model of legislative vote, in which legislators play a strategic game and also decide whether to run for reelection or not. I find that legislators weigh on average approximately 34% reelection payoffs and 66% social welfare when choosing seats. With these results, I run some counterfactual analyses varying the population caps’ function that federal government chooses. </p>

# Work in Progress

- **Genocide and the Demand for Formal Institutions: Evidence from the Legacy of the Khmer Rouge** (with Joris Mueller)

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Cambodian genocide under the Khmer Rouge regime is remembered as one of the worst human tragedies of the 20th century. This paper examines the social and institutional legacies of this violent episode. We document that spatially more intense violence committed by the Khmer Rouge, proxied by exogenous adverse rainfall shocks during 1975–1977, is associated with a higher fraction of land covered by government-backed land titles in Cambodia today. We provide micro-level empirical evidence that social capital may play a role in explaining this result: Communities that experienced more violence had more of their social capital destroyed, increasing the demand for formal titles. We conclude that social capital may serve as a substitute for formal institutions in a context of weak state capacity. We complement our analysis by discussing several alternative mechanisms. </p>

# Philosophy

- **Is Economics a Science? Not Yet.** [[SSRN](http://ssrn.com/abstract=3036961){:target="_blank"}]

   <p style="text-align: justify;"> Is economics a science? Answering this question is not only necessary for philosophical clarity, but also crucial for knowing how seriously to take economists’ claims and advice about public policy. Nevertheless, even among practitioners and academics, consensus is nonexistent. This paper resolves the conundrum in two steps. First I discuss some epistemology of science, defining clearly various concepts necessary to the debate. Several fallacies are clarified, such as "a theory may never be proved true, but only not falsified", "a model is useful because it simplifies reality" or "data mining is bad". In light of solid philosophical ground, I then discuss the practice and methodology of modern economics. The answer to the title question is a perhaps disappointing, but realistic, not yet. I conclude with prescriptions for a path towards a more scientific discipline.  </p>

- **On Randomness and Probability** [[pdf](/files/papers/randomness_probability.pdf){:target="_blank"}]

  <p style="text-align: justify;"> This essay provides coherent definitions of two bedrock concepts in philosophy and statistics: randomness and probability. When constructing the first, I define repeatability, the measurement set, and distinguish between frequency vs. value prediction. The definition of randomness proposed, namely of a random variable not being perfectly value-predictable for any given information set, is stronger than those commonly used in the literature. Second, after defining probability as a theory about a variable's potential frequency distribution, I argue that the dichotomy between frequentist and bayesian interpretations is illusory. I conclude with remarks about knowledge and determinism.  </p>
