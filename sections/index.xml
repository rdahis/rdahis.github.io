My research interests lie at the intersection of Development, Politics, and Environmental Economics. I hold a Ph.D in Economics from Northwestern University.
My research has been published in journals such as the Review of Economics and Statistics and the Journal of Public Economics.
I have co-founded Data Basis (Base dos Dados), a nonprofit start-up with the mission to make access to high-quality data universal in Brazil and internationally.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rdahis.github.io/sections/advising-teaching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rdahis.github.io/sections/advising-teaching/</guid><description>For current and prospective students, RAs, and postdocs: please read this.
