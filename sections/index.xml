My research interests lie at the intersection of Development, Politics, and Environmental Economics. I connect theory-driven questions to granular data and natural experiments to learn about the process of development in low- and middle-income countries.
I have co-founded and lead the data team at Base dos Dados, a nonprofit start-up with the mission to make access to high-quality data universal in Brazil.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rdahis.github.io/sections/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rdahis.github.io/sections/contact/</guid><description>Email: rdahis@econ.puc-rio.br
