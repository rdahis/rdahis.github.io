Below are links to materials that are useful in my research and maybe will be in yours too. My philosophy is that public goods must be made public.

- Working Structure for Empirical Papers [[folder link](/data/main_paper.zip)]
  - This folder provides an all-encompassing working structure for empirical papers. It organizes every step of the process: merging and cleaning (several) data sets, performing analyses (tables, figures, regressions), writing the article itself and also presentations.
  - Customize to fit your project.
  - Particularly useful for work involving multiple coauthors and RAs.
  - Principles: functional folder structure, modularity and automation.
  - Read the README file for more information.
  - References: Gentzkow & Shapiro (2014).
  - Continuously under improvement. Suggestions are welcome, please just email me.

- Match for TSE and IBGE municipality identificators [[folder link](/data/Match TSE IBGE.zip)]
  - This data set matches the identificators and names of Brazilian municipalities across the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) and the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica (IBGE).
  - Covers years 1996 to 2012.
  - It also makes the match consistent across years.
  - TSE and IBGE ids and name strings change across years.
  - Municipalities are created or cease to exist across years.
  - Read the README for more information.
  - Continuously under improvement. For corrections and suggestions, please just email me.

- Match for TSE and Congress federal deputy identificators [[folder link](/data/Match Author Candidate Year.zip)]
  - This data set matches the names of federal deputies between the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) and the Congress in Brazil. It also creates a unique id number and name for each person across years, covering 1998 to 2010.
  - Read the README for more information.
  - Continuously under improvement. For corrections and suggestions, please just email me.
