– For better or worse, I’m just glad it’s over.

– In terms of predicting outcomes, Political Science took as big a hit as Economics with the Great Recession.

– Exit polls are insightful.
Trump voters were largely old, white, not college educated, middle class, living in small cities/rural, protestant/christian, married, worried about immigration and terrorism, that think the economy is in terrible shape, and whose economic situation has been deteriorating in recent years. Big part of this group were already republicans, but Trump outperformed Romney here.

– Democracy is working, like it or not. People voted (somehow) freely. We can, however, discuss whether people know what’s best for them and whether Trump, with his authoritarian bent, could destabilize American institutions (unlikely, I think).

– Hillary will probably just fade out in politics.

– Second hugely consequential election in 16 years where the winner on popular votes lost the election. It makes one reconsider the electoral college system.

– Would Sanders have a better chance against Trump? I highly doubt it.

– Will Canada build a wall?

– Will I miss Obama? Dearly.

– Young liberal rich educated urban millennials are having a hard time making sense of this result. Part because higher education is isolated, insular and liberal, and average voters aren’t. But also because our whole lives are encapsulated: in the people we talk to, the media we consume, where you live, etc. The country’s average reality is starkly different, and conservative values make very little sense to urban millennials.

– 2016 gave us Brexit, Colombia’s disagreement with FARCs and Trump. What will come next?

– The validation this election gives to xenophobia and racism worries me.

– What will be the consequences of a Trump presidency? Well, it’s hard to predict now. Republicans have the majority in Congress, but a lot will depend on how much Trump and other republicans converge and collaborate. Will Trump change the party or vice versa? Given Trump’s temperament and republican’s electoral incentives, it’s hard to predict what will happen.

– We can still attribute high probability to some things happening: repealing Obamacare, Supreme Court appointments, some immigration reform, tax cuts for upper class/rich people, steps back on climate change, trade repeals.

– I’m deeply scared (and you should be too) about Trump, republicans and climate change. He denies the phenomenon, which is basically consensus in the scientific community. Plus, effects of climate change (mass immigration, food shortages, water scarcity, etc) will fall first and foremost on the world’s poor. A huge externality to this election.
