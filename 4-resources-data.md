Below are links to materials that are useful in my research and maybe will be in yours too. My philosophy is that public goods must be made public.

- [Working Structure for Empirical Papers](https://github.com/rdahis/main_paper){:target="_blank"}
  - This folder provides an all-encompassing working structure for empirical papers. It organizes every step of the process: merging and cleaning (several) data sets, performing analyses (tables, figures, regressions), writing the article itself and also presentations.
  - Customize to fit your project.
  - Particularly useful for work involving multiple coauthors and RAs.
  - Principles: functional folder structure, modularity and automation.
  - Read the README file for more information.
  - References: Gentzkow & Shapiro (2014).
  - Continuously under improvement. Suggestions are welcome, please just email me.

- [Data Repository](https://github.com/rdahis/data){:target="_blank"}
    - Matching IDs for Brazilian municipalities.
        - This data set matches identificators and names of Brazilian municipalities across various institutions (IBGE, TSE, STN, and Comarcas).
        - It tracks what municipalities existed in 1991, 2000, 2010, and currently.
    - Matching IDs for legislators across TSE and Congress.
        - This data set matches the names of federal deputies between the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) and the Congress in Brazil. It also creates a unique id number and name for each person across years, covering 1998 to 2010.
